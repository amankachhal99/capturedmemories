   	   	  	    <p class="m_2">"Abhinav & Aman" are photographers based in Delhi, an engineers by education and photographers by passion, we feels that the kind of passion that is put into his pictures is more than just work. We have been working towards ideas which are not bound by principles but are driven by imagination. Now, several years later, we find ourself precisely where we wanted to be when he first started our career – behind the lens, doing something that we loves. It’s been three years that we are living photography and for us work became our life, passion and profession. With a penchant for making “fun” photos, we love creating behind the scenes memories that will last a lifetime.
								For us every wedding is diffrent, so every story is going to be diffrent.</p>
